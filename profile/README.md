# VibeInProd

Designed for seed to Series A AI startups scaling beyond prototype stage.

## Stop Your AI Codebase From Collapsing

We stabilize AI-generated codebases in 10 days to restore shipping velocity, reduce technical risk, and improve investor confidence.

We work with funded teams using Cursor, Claude, and other AI tools to turn fragile vibe code into production-ready systems.

## Who This Is For

- Seed to Series A AI startups scaling beyond MVP
- CTOs, technical CEOs, and founding engineering teams
- Teams preparing for technical due diligence or Series A scrutiny

Not for large enterprises with mature platform teams.

## What We Deliver

- **Technical due diligence clarity**: what is salvageable, what needs rewriting, and what can block scale or fundraising
- **Architecture integrity**: reduce rewrite probability and scaling risk before growth breaks your stack
- **Hands-on stabilization**: dead code removal, duplication cleanup, security fixes, and flaky logic hardening

## How to Get Started

1. **Free Mini Cleanup Report**
	- Get your 5 biggest AI-code risks and immediate next steps.
2. **AI Code Audit Sprint**
	- Deep-dive audit with a prioritized cleanup roadmap.
3. **Stabilization Week**
	- Hands-on remediation for a codebase you can build on.

## Methodology

Our framework is designed for funded startups that need measurable progress fast:

- **AI Stability Index™**: 10-point score across duplication, dead code, security, flakiness, and scalability
- **AI Architecture Risk Map™**: prioritize rewrite probability and scaling exposure
- **AI Scaling Integrity Framework™**: Assess → Stabilize → Harmonize

## Typical Outcomes

- Lower code duplication
- Less dead code and fewer random failures
- Fewer critical security risks from AI-generated patterns
- Faster onboarding and more predictable delivery
